# AlgoMaestro - Chat-Driven Algorithmic Trading Agent

An AI-powered trading agent that converts natural language strategy descriptions into production-ready algorithmic trading systems with automated execution, backtesting, and risk management.

## Problem Summary (What Traders Struggle With)

**Slow trade execution & slippage** — manual workflows and slow hand-offs cause missed fills and worse prices.

**Emotional & inconsistent trading** — humans overtrade, deviate from rules, or revenge-trade after losses.

**Limited availability / monitoring** — traders can't watch markets 24/7.

**Long development-to-deployment cycle** — coding, testing, and deploying strategies takes time and engineering skill.

**Poor reproducibility & auditability** — strategies get changed informally; hard to reproduce past results.

**Risk & money-management lapses** — position sizing, stop-loss rules, and execution constraints are not enforced consistently.

**Integration friction** — connecting data feeds, backtest engines, brokers (e.g., MetaTrader5) and local user environments is painful.

**Slow iteration on strategy ideas** — testing many variants is time-consuming and error-prone.

## How the Chat-Coding Agent Solves Each Problem

### Fast, deterministic execution (reduces slippage)
**How:** Agent generates production-ready execution code that runs locally (user-side bridge) or on a low-latency server and uses direct broker SDKs (e.g., MetaTrader5 Python SDK).

**Effect:** Orders are sent automatically with minimal human delay; fewer manual steps → lower slippage.

### Emotionless, rules-based trading (improves accuracy & discipline)
**How:** The agent codifies the trader's strategy into deterministic entry/exit/size rules and enforces them in runtime.

**Effect:** Eliminates human deviations (overtrading, revenge trades), ensuring consistent behaviour.

### 24/7 availability & automated market monitoring
**How:** Deployable agents (containers or local processes) run continuously, monitoring signals and market conditions. Alerts and auto-pauses are supported.

**Effect:** Trades can execute whenever strategy conditions are met, day or night.

### Rapid strategy creation → test → deploy loop
**How:** Chat interface accepts plain-language strategy specs; agent produces coded strategy + unit tests + backtest harness. Integrated backtester runs simulations on historical data and returns metrics.

**Effect:** Traders iterate faster: idea → validated backtest → paper/live deployment in the same workflow.

### Reproducibility, versioning & audit logs
**How:** Agent outputs code, config files, and human-readable strategy summaries. All deployments produce immutable logs and trade history; version-controlled artifacts (git) are created automatically.

**Effect:** Full traceability of what was run and when — essential for debugging and compliance.

### Built-in risk controls & position sizing
**How:** Agent enforces configurable risk rules (fixed % risk, ATR-based stops, max drawdown caps) and position-sizing formulas. These become mandatory parts of generated strategy code.

**Effect:** Reduces catastrophic mistakes and preserves capital automatically.

### Seamless integrations & user-local bridging
**How:** Agent scaffolds connectors: historical/data feeds, exchange/broker adapters, and a lightweight local bridge (Python) to accept signals in browser → local MT5 terminal or other broker SDKs. Use n8n or message queues to connect backend → user.

**Effect:** Smooth signal path from agent to broker with minimal manual setup; compatible with users' Windows machines (local bridge) or containerized servers.

### Scale testing & optimization
**How:** Agent can generate batched strategy-variant tests (parameter sweeps), run backtests in parallel, and return summarized performance metrics.

**Effect:** Quickly finds promising parameter sets and avoids manual backtesting drudgery.

## System Components (Concise Architecture)

**Chat Agent UI** — accepts natural-language strategy descriptions and trade requests.

**Code Generator** — converts spec → production-ready strategy code + unit/backtest tests.

**Backtest Engine** — historical simulation (with fees, slippage models, and realistic fills).

**Orchestrator / CI** — validates tests, runs automated backtests, packages artifacts.

**Execution Bridge(s)**
- Remote server for low-latency deployments (optional).
- Local bridge (user machine) for direct MT5 execution via MT5 Python SDK (user-side Python process).

**Risk & Compliance Module** — enforces stops, drawdown limits, KYC/ compliance hooks.

**Monitoring & Alerting** — live dashboards, logs, and notifications (SMS/Telegram/Email).

**Storage** — time-series database for tick/history, Postgres for configs, logging store for audit trails.

**Message Bus** — reliable signal delivery (Redis streams / RabbitMQ / Kafka) between modules.

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Checklist

- [ ] Chat interface that captures a clear strategy spec.
- [ ] Code generator that outputs a runnable Python strategy file.
- [ ] Local bridge that sends signals to MetaTrader5 (MT5) Python API on user's Windows machine.
- [ ] Backtester that runs a historical simulation and returns basic metrics (P&L, drawdown, winrate).
- [ ] Risk enforcement (stop-loss, max position size).
- [ ] Logging and versioned artifact storage.

## Example User Flow

Trader chats: "Create a mean-reversion strategy: entry when price deviates 2σ from 20-period SMA, exit at mean or after 3% loss; risk 1% per trade." Agent returns: 1) Python strategy file, 2) config with risk params, 3) backtest results on requested dataset, 4) a packaged deployable with a deploy.sh that starts a local bridge and connects to MT5. Trader reviews, runs paper mode, and toggles to live when satisfied.

## Non-Functional & Operational Requirements

**Latency target:** define max ms from signal → broker (e.g., <100ms for market orders where applicable).

**Security:** authenticated agent sessions, encrypted local bridge, API keys stored only on user machine or encrypted vault.

**Reliability:** retry/backoff for order submission, circuit-breaker on repeated failures.

**Observability:** structured logs, metrics (latency, fills, slippage), and alerts for rule breaches.

**Testing:** unit tests for generated code, integration tests for broker interactions, and replay tests for new strategies.

## Risks & Mitigations

**Incorrect strategy translation:** require formal strategy schema and automated unit tests; have human review step for high-risk live deployments.

**Execution errors / connectivity:** implement safe defaults (paper-mode first), retry logic, and manual kill-switch.

**Overfitting during optimization:** limit parameter sweeps, use walk-forward validation and out-of-sample testing.

**Regulatory/compliance issues:** include configurable guardrails and trading limits; log all trades for audits.
